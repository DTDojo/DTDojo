Counting Code Kata
-------------------------

We will keep it simple (or complicated) this time around. Write a program that takes a java file as an input and counts the lines of code in it. Comment lines do not count, nor lines containing only braces in it.

To get you started, and confused:

[sample1.java](http://github.com/DTDojo/DTDojo/tree/master/src/kata10/sample1.java):
2 lines -- simple case  

[sample2.java](http://github.com/DTDojo/DTDojo/tree/master/src/kata10/sample2.java):
3 lines -- pathological case     

Feel free to add any java samples you find interesting here. The more, the better!

This kata, and both examples, were shamelessly stolen from [here](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_thirteen_c.html).
