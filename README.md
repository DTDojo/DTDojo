DTCodingDojo
-----------------------

## What is the DT Coding Dojo?

The DT Coding Dojo is a meeting of programmers who like to practice their coding / algorithm / framework skills. Near the end of each week this page will present a new programming problem, something that might take about an hour of work to solve. When we meet on Monday, we will go over the problem and present our solutions in the form of working code.

## Format

Meetings happen every Monday at 5 PM at the Bayes conference room and will follow the following agenda:

  - Discuss previous meeting and go over what can be improved (5 minutes max.)
  - Discuss this week's problem.
  - Review everybody's code:
      - Present the code (show unit tests running)
      - Describe the algorithm
      - General comments as desired. 
  - Go over proposals for next week's problem. 

Don't forget to bring your laptop so we can see your code in action!

## Questions (and Answers)

__What programming languages can I use?__

  - You are free to code your solutions in any language you want. We would appreciate unit tests so we can believe your solution works. Current popular languages we are using are Java, Ruby, Perl and Python.

__I didn't have time to work on the problems, may I still go to the DTCodingDojo?__ 

  - You are always welcome to come as an observer, though you will benefit more from the experience if you have tried solving the problem.
